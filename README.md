# Material Theme for Mac Terminal

A Mac OS Terminal profile, using a Material Design color palette. Based on [Hyperterm Material Dark](https://github.com/jbw91/hyperterm-material-dark).

## Using this Profile

Open the Mac Terminal app. Go to Terminal > Preferences > Profiles. Click on the gear at the bottom-left of the window and select "Import". Select the `Material.terminal` file from this repo and import it. Now, click on the "Material" profile and make sure to click "Default" at the bottom-left of the screen to make this the default profile that is used on startup!

Enjoy. :)
